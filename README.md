  This is a console-based program that simulates a casion game which consists of many minor games. The goal 
  for this project was to learn C++ programming language and explore its features. To test the program make sure 
  that you have visual studio installed on your machine then download the program as a zip file and extract it. Once done 
  you can open it on visual studio and run it as normal. You can find guidance on how to play the game once you run it and choose the help option.
